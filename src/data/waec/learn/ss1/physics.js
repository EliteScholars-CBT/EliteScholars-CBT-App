Before solving any physics problem, we must agree on how to <em>measure</em> things. <span class=\"learn-keyword\">Physical quantities</span> are properties of matter or phenomena that can be measured. Every measurement requires both a number and a <span class=\"learn-keyword\">unit</span>. The international standard system of measurement used in science worldwide is the <span class=\"learn-keyword\">Système Internationale (SI)</span>, adopted by Nigeria and all modern scientific communities.\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"learn-subheading\">1. Physical Quantities</h3>\n<p class=\"learn-p\">A <span class=\"learn-keyword\">physical quantity</span> is any property that can be measured and expressed as a number with a unit. Examples: length (5 metres), mass (70 kilograms), time (3 seconds), force (20 newtons). Physical quantities are classified into two types: fundamental (base) and derived.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"learn-subheading\">2.

Every measurement involves choosing an appropriate instrument, using it correctly, and understanding the limitations of the measurement. This topic covers the measurement of four fundamental quantities — mass, weight, length, and time — with the instruments used, the concept of accuracy, and the types of errors that affect measurements. In Nigerian everyday life, measurement is critical: from weighing produce in Balogun Market to timing sprinters at national championships.\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"learn-subheading\">1. Mass and Its Measurement</h3>\n<p class=\"learn-p\"><span class=\"learn-keyword\">Mass</span> is the quantity of matter in a body. It is a scalar quantity and remains constant regardless of location (same on Earth as on the Moon). SI unit: kilogram (kg).</p>\n<ul class=\"learn-list\">\n  <li><strong>Beam balance:</strong> Compares unknown mass with known standard masses. Works on any planet. Used in chemistry labs, gold markets.</li>\n  <li><strong>Electronic balance:</strong> Measures mass digitally. Very accurate. Used in hospitals, pharmacies (like in Lagos medical labs).</li>\n  <li><strong>Spring balance (for weight, not mass):</strong> Reads weight (force of gravity) which varies with location.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"learn-subheading\">2. Weight and Its Measurement</h3>\n<p class=\"learn-p\"><span class=\"learn-keyword\">Weight</span> is the gravitational force acting on a body. It is a vector quantity (has both magnitude and direction — always toward Earth's centre). W = mg, where g = gravitational field strength (≈ 9.8 m/s² on Earth's surface). SI unit: newton (N).</p>\n<p class=\"learn-p\"><strong>Key distinction:</strong> A bag of rice has mass 50 kg everywhere, but weight = 50 × 9.8 = 490 N on Earth, and only about 81 N on the Moon (g_moon ≈ 1.6 m/s²).</p>\n\n<div class=\"learn-table-wrap\">\n  <table class=\"learn-table\">\n    <thead><tr><th>Property</th><th>Mass</th><th>Weight</th></tr></thead>\n    <tbody>\n      <tr><td>Definition</td><td>Amount of matter</td><td>Gravitational force on body</td></tr>\n      <tr><td>Type</td><td>Scalar</td><td>Vector</td></tr>\n      <tr><td>SI Unit</td><td>kilogram (kg)</td><td>newton (N)</td></tr>\n      <tr><td>Measured with</td><td>Beam balance</td><td>Spring balance</td></tr>\n      <tr><td>Changes with location?</td><td>No — constant everywhere</td><td>Yes — varies with g</td></tr>\n      <tr><td>Can it be zero?</td><td>Never (matter always has mass)</td><td>Yes — in space (zero g)</td></tr>\n    </tbody>\n  </table>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"learn-subheading\">3.

Accuracy, Precision, and Errors</h3>\n<p class=\"learn-p\"><span class=\"learn-keyword\">Accuracy</span> refers to how close a measurement is to the true (actual) value. <span class=\"learn-keyword\">Precision</span> refers to how repeatable or consistent measurements are — how close repeated measurements are to each other (but not necessarily to the true value).</p>\n<ul class=\"learn-list\">\n  <li><strong>Systematic error:</strong> Consistent error that affects all measurements by the same amount in the same direction. Caused by: zero error in instruments, parallax error, incorrectly calibrated instruments. Can be corrected by recalibrating or subtracting the error.</li>\n  <li><strong>Random error:</strong> Unpredictable errors that vary in magnitude and direction between measurements. Caused by: human reaction time, environmental fluctuations. Reduced by taking many readings and averaging.</li>\n  <li><strong>Zero error:</strong> An instrument reads a non-zero value when the correct reading should be zero. Must be corrected: true reading = observed − zero error.</li>\n  <li><strong>Parallax error:</strong> Error due to the observer's eye not being directly in line with the scale pointer. Avoided by viewing at right angles to the scale.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div class=\"learn-tip-box\">\n  <span class=\"learn-tip-icon\">💡</span>\n  <strong>Exam Tip — Mass vs Weight:</strong> A very common exam question distinguishes mass from weight. Remember: mass is measured by a BEAM balance (uses gravitational force equally on both sides), weight by a SPRING balance (uses spring extension). Mass stays constant everywhere; weight changes with gravitational field strength g. An astronaut has the same mass on the Moon as on Earth, but their weight is ⅙ on the Moon.\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"learn-tip-box\">\n  <span class=\"learn-tip-icon\">🎯</span>\n  <strong>Summary:</strong> Mass (kg) = amount of matter, constant, measured by beam balance. Weight (N) = gravitational force = mg, varies with location, measured by spring balance. Length instruments: metre rule (1mm), vernier callipers (0.1mm), micrometer (0.01mm). Time measured by stopwatch, pendulum clock, ticker timer. Accuracy = closeness to true value; precision = repeatability. Errors: systematic (consistent, correctable) vs random (unpredictable, reducible by averaging).\n</div>\n  ",

The concepts of position, distance, and displacement form the foundation for all of kinematics — the study of motion. The critical distinction between distance (a scalar) and displacement (a vector) is one of the most fundamental ideas in physics and has practical significance in navigation, GPS systems, sports, and engineering.\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"learn-subheading\">1. Position</h3>\n<p class=\"learn-p\"><span class=\"learn-keyword\">Position</span> describes the location of an object relative to a reference point (origin). In one dimension, position is simply a value on a number line (positive or negative depending on direction from origin). In two dimensions, position requires coordinates (x, y). Position is a vector quantity — it specifies both how far and in what direction from the reference point.</p>\n<p class=\"learn-p\"><strong>Example:</strong> A student starts at the gate of a school (origin). They walk 50 m North. Their position is \"50 m North of the gate.\"</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"learn-subheading\">2. Distance</h3>\n<p class=\"learn-p\"><span class=\"learn-keyword\">Distance</span> is the total length of path travelled by an object, regardless of direction. It is a <strong>scalar quantity</strong> — it has magnitude only, no direction. Distance can only be zero or positive, never negative.</p>\n<ul class=\"learn-list\">\n  <li>Distance measures the complete path length.</li>\n  <li>It depends on the actual route taken.</li>\n  <li>SI unit: metre (m)</li>\n  <li>Example: A runner completes a 400m track circuit — distance = 400 m.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"learn-subheading\">3. Displacement</h3>\n<p class=\"learn-p\"><span class=\"learn-keyword\">Displacement</span> is the straight-line distance from the starting point to the ending point, measured in a specific direction. It is a <strong>vector quantity</strong> — it has both magnitude and direction.</p>\n<ul class=\"learn-list\">\n  <li>Displacement = final position − initial position.</li>\n  <li>It depends only on start and end points, not the path taken.</li>\n  <li>Displacement can be zero even if distance is not (e.g., returning to start).</li>\n  <li>SI unit: metre (m), with direction specified.</li>\n  <li>Example: The same 400m track runner returns to start — displacement = 0 m.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div class=\"learn-svg-wrap\">\n  <svg class=\"learn-svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 480 200\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n    <rect width=\"480\" height=\"200\" fill=\"#0f0020\" rx=\"10\"/>\n    <text x=\"240\" y=\"18\" text-anchor=\"middle\" fill=\"#D4AF37\" font-size=\"11\" font-weight=\"bold\">Distance vs Displacement</text>\n    <rect x=\"10\" y=\"30\" width=\"220\" height=\"155\" rx=\"8\" fill=\"#1a0030\" stroke=\"#4B0082\" stroke-width=\"1.5\"/>\n    <rect x=\"250\" y=\"30\" width=\"220\" height=\"155\" rx=\"8\" fill=\"#1a0030\" stroke=\"#28c840\" stroke-width=\"1.5\"/>\n    <!-- Path diagram left: winding path -->\n    <circle cx=\"40\" cy=\"160\" r=\"5\" fill=\"#D4AF37\"/>\n    <text x=\"38\" y=\"175\" fill=\"#D4AF37\" font-size=\"7\">Start</text>\n    <path d=\"M40,160 Q80,130 110,120 Q140,110 160,90 Q180,70 200,60\" stroke=\"#ff9500\" stroke-width=\"2.5\" fill=\"none\"/>\n    <circle cx=\"200\" cy=\"60\" r=\"5\" fill=\"#28c840\"/>\n    <text x=\"195\" y=\"52\" fill=\"#28c840\" font-size=\"7\">End</text>\n    <text x=\"120\" y=\"190\" text-anchor=\"middle\" fill=\"#ff9500\" font-size=\"8\">Distance = actual path length</text>\n    <text x=\"120\" y=\"50\" text-anchor=\"middle\" fill=\"#D4AF37\" font-size=\"9\" font-weight=\"bold\">DISTANCE (scalar)</text>\n    <!-- Displacement diagram right: straight line -->\n    <circle cx=\"280\" cy=\"160\" r=\"5\" fill=\"#D4AF37\"/>\n    <text x=\"278\" y=\"175\" fill=\"#D4AF37\" font-size=\"7\">Start</text>\n    <line x1=\"280\" y1=\"160\" x2=\"440\" y2=\"60\" stroke=\"#28c840\" stroke-width=\"3\"/>\n    <circle cx=\"440\" cy=\"60\" r=\"5\" fill=\"#28c840\"/>\n    <text x=\"440\" y=\"52\" fill=\"#28c840\" font-size=\"7\">End</text>\n    <text x=\"372\" y=\"120\" fill=\"#28c840\" font-size=\"8\" transform=\"rotate(-30,372,120)\">Displacement</text>\n    <path d=\"M430,75 L440,60 L450,78\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"#28c840\" stroke-width=\"2\"/>\n    <text x=\"370\" y=\"190\" text-anchor=\"middle\" fill=\"#28c840\" font-size=\"8\">Displacement = straight-line, A to B</text>\n    <text x=\"370\" y=\"50\" text-anchor=\"middle\" fill=\"#D4AF37\" font-size=\"9\" font-weight=\"bold\">DISPLACEMENT (vector)</text>\n    <rect x=\"10\" y=\"30\" width=\"220\" height=\"155\" rx=\"8\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"#D4AF37\" stroke-width=\"1\">\n      <animate attributeName=\"opacity\" values=\"0.3;0.8;0.3\" dur=\"2s\" repeatCount=\"indefinite\"/>\n    </rect>\n  </svg>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"learn-subheading\">4.

Practical Examples</h3>\n<p class=\"learn-p\"><strong>Example 1:</strong> A bus travels from Lagos to Ibadan (125 km) along the expressway, then returns to Lagos. Total distance = 250 km. Displacement = 0 km (back at starting point).</p>\n<p class=\"learn-p\"><strong>Example 2:</strong> A student walks 3 km East, then 4 km North. Distance = 3 + 4 = 7 km. Displacement = √(3² + 4²) = 5 km in direction North-East (at angle tan⁻¹(4/3) = 53° from East). The displacement uses the resultant vector.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"learn-subheading\">6. Position-Time Graphs</h3>\n<p class=\"learn-p\">A position-time graph plots an object's position (y-axis) against time (x-axis). Key features:</p>\n<ul class=\"learn-list\">\n  <li>Slope (gradient) = velocity (not speed).</li>\n  <li>A horizontal line = object at rest (no change in position).</li>\n  <li>A straight line = constant velocity (uniform motion).</li>\n  <li>A curve = changing velocity (acceleration).</li>\n  <li>Negative slope = object moving in negative direction (e.g., returning toward origin).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div class=\"learn-tip-box\">\n  <span class=\"learn-tip-icon\">💡</span>\n  <strong>Exam Tip — Displacement vs Distance:</strong> \"A car travels around a circular track of circumference 800m and returns to the starting point.\" Distance = 800m. Displacement = 0m (start = end). When the question asks for \"how far from the start?\" it wants displacement (straight line). When it asks \"how far did it travel?\" it wants distance (total path). These are the most common ways examiners test this concept.\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"learn-tip-box\">\n  <span class=\"learn-tip-icon\">🎯</span>\n  <strong>Summary:</strong> Position = location relative to reference point (vector). Distance = total path length (scalar, always ≥ 0). Displacement = straight-line distance from start to finish with direction (vector, can be negative or zero). Key: distance ≥ displacement. Displacement = 0 when start = finish. On position-time graphs: gradient = velocity. Displacement is calculated using vector methods when paths change direction.\n</div>\n  ",

    "contentHTML": "\n<div class=\"learn-intro\">\n  Every physical quantity falls into one of two categories: <span class=\"learn-keyword\">scalar</span> quantities (described by magnitude alone) and <span class=\"learn-keyword\">vector</span> quantities (requiring both magnitude and direction). This distinction is fundamental — it determines how quantities can be added, subtracted, and used in calculations. Understanding vectors is essential for analysing forces, velocities, and many other physical phenomena.\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"learn-subheading\">1. Scalar Quantities</h3>\n<p class=\"learn-p\">A <span class=\"learn-keyword\">scalar</span> is a quantity with magnitude only — no direction needed to describe it fully. Scalars follow ordinary arithmetic: 5 kg + 3 kg = 8 kg (always).</p>\n<p class=\"learn-p\"><strong>Examples of scalars:</strong> mass, distance, speed, time, temperature, energy, volume, density, pressure, electric charge, frequency.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"learn-subheading\">2. Vector Quantities</h3>\n<p class=\"learn-p\">A <span class=\"learn-keyword\">vector</span> is a quantity with both magnitude and direction. The same magnitude in different directions represents different vectors. Vectors require special rules for addition.</p>\n<p class=\"learn-p\"><strong>Examples of vectors:</strong> displacement, velocity, acceleration, force, momentum, weight, electric field, magnetic field.</p>\n\n<div class=\"learn-table-wrap\">\n  <table class=\"learn-table\">\n    <thead><tr><th>Scalar</th><th>Related Vector</th><th>Difference</th></tr></thead>\n    <tbody>\n      <tr><td>Distance (50 m)</td><td>Displacement (50 m North)</td><td>Displacement specifies direction</td></tr>\n      <tr><td>Speed (20 m/s)</td><td>Velocity (20 m/s East)</td><td>Velocity specifies direction</td></tr>\n      <tr><td>Mass (70 kg)</td><td>Weight (686 N downward)</td><td>Weight specifies direction</td></tr>\n    </tbody>\n  </table>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"learn-subheading\">3. Vector Representation</h3>\n<p class=\"learn-p\">Vectors are represented by arrows where:</p>\n<ul class=\"learn-list\">\n  <li>The <strong>length</strong> of the arrow represents the <strong>magnitude</strong> (drawn to scale).</li>\n  <li>The <strong>direction</strong> of the arrow represents the <strong>direction</strong> of the vector.</li>\n  <li>Vectors are written in bold (**F**) or with an arrow (→F) or underlined (F).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"learn-subheading\">4. Addition of Vectors</h3>\n<h4 class=\"learn-subsubheading\">Graphical Method (Triangle/Parallelogram Rule)</h4>\n<p class=\"learn-p\">Vectors in the same direction: add magnitudes. Vectors in opposite directions: subtract magnitudes. Vectors at an angle: use graphical or analytical methods.</p>\n<p class=\"learn-p\"><strong>Triangle Rule:</strong> Draw the first vector, then draw the second vector starting from the tip of the first. The resultant goes from the tail of the first to the tip of the second.</p>\n<p class=\"learn-p\"><strong>Parallelogram Rule:</strong> Draw both vectors from the same point. Complete the parallelogram. The diagonal from the common starting point is the resultant.</p>\n\n<div class=\"learn-svg-wrap\">\n  <svg class=\"learn-svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 480 200\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n    <rect width=\"480\" height=\"200\" fill=\"#0f0020\" rx=\"10\"/>\n    <text x=\"240\" y=\"18\" text-anchor=\"middle\" fill=\"#D4AF37\" font-size=\"11\" font-weight=\"bold\">Vector Addition — Triangle Rule</text>\n    <!-- Vector A -->\n    <line x1=\"40\" y1=\"130\" x2=\"160\" y2=\"130\" stroke=\"#D4AF37\" stroke-width=\"3\"/>\n    <polygon points=\"158,125 168,130 158,135\" fill=\"#D4AF37\"/>\n    <text x=\"100\" y=\"122\" text-anchor=\"middle\" fill=\"#D4AF37\" font-size=\"9\">A = 120 m (East)</text>\n    <!-- Vector B from tip of A -->\n    <line x1=\"160\" y1=\"130\" x2=\"220\" y2=\"70\" stroke=\"#28c840\" stroke-width=\"3\"/>\n    <polygon points=\"213,65 220,70 215,78\" fill=\"#28c840\"/>\n    <text x=\"210\" y=\"95\" fill=\"#28c840\" font-size=\"9\">B = 90 m (NE)</text>\n    <!-- Resultant -->\n    <line x1=\"40\" y1=\"130\" x2=\"220\" y2=\"70\" stroke=\"#ff5f57\" stroke-width=\"2.5\" stroke-dasharray=\"6,3\"/>\n    <polygon points=\"213,65 222,70 216,78\" fill=\"#ff5f57\"/>\n    <text x=\"100\" y=\"95\" fill=\"#ff5f57\" font-size=\"9\">R (Resultant)</text>\n    <!-- Labels -->\n    <text x=\"40\" y=\"148\" fill=\"#9090b0\" font-size=\"8\">Start (tail of A)</text>\n    <text x=\"155\" y=\"148\" fill=\"#9090b0\" font-size=\"8\">Tip of A</text>\n    <text x=\"222\" y=\"68\" fill=\"#9090b0\" font-size=\"8\">End</text>\n    <!-- Parallelogram Rule diagram -->\n    <text x=\"370\" y=\"45\" text-anchor=\"middle\" fill=\"#D4AF37\" font-size=\"10\" font-weight=\"bold\">Parallelogram Rule</text>\n    <line x1=\"310\" y1=\"150\" x2=\"430\" y2=\"150\" stroke=\"#D4AF37\" stroke-width=\"2.5\"/>\n    <polygon points=\"428,145 438,150 428,155\" fill=\"#D4AF37\"/>\n    <line x1=\"310\" y1=\"150\" x2=\"350\" y2=\"80\" stroke=\"#28c840\" stroke-width=\"2.5\"/>\n    <polygon points=\"344,77 350,80 348,89\" fill=\"#28c840\"/>\n    <line x1=\"430\" y1=\"150\" x2=\"470\" y2=\"80\" stroke=\"#28c840\" stroke-width=\"1.5\" stroke-dasharray=\"4,2\"/>\n    <line x1=\"350\" y1=\"80\" x2=\"470\" y2=\"80\" stroke=\"#D4AF37\" stroke-width=\"1.5\" stroke-dasharray=\"4,2\"/>\n    <line x1=\"310\" y1=\"150\" x2=\"470\" y2=\"80\" stroke=\"#ff5f57\" stroke-width=\"2.5\" stroke-dasharray=\"5,3\"/>\n    <polygon points=\"462,77 470,80 465,88\" fill=\"#ff5f57\"/>\n    <text x=\"395\" y=\"175\" text-anchor=\"middle\" fill=\"#ff5f57\" font-size=\"8\">Diagonal = Resultant R</text>\n    <rect x=\"10\" y=\"28\" width=\"460\" height=\"165\" rx=\"8\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"#D4AF37\" stroke-width=\"1\">\n      <animate attributeName=\"opacity\" values=\"0.3;0.8;0.3\" dur=\"2s\" repeatCount=\"indefinite\"/>\n    </rect>\n  </svg>\n</div>\n\n<h4 class=\"learn-subsubheading\">Analytical Method (Using Trigonometry)</h4>\n<p class=\"learn-p\">For vectors at right angles: R = √(A² + B²), with direction θ = tan⁻¹(B/A)</p>\n<p class=\"learn-p\"><strong>Example:</strong> Forces 3 N East and 4 N North act on a body.

Resolution of Vectors</h3>\n<p class=\"learn-p\">Any vector can be broken into two components at right angles (usually horizontal and vertical). This is called <span class=\"learn-keyword\">resolution</span>.</p>\n<p class=\"learn-p\">For a vector F at angle θ to the horizontal:</p>\n<ul class=\"learn-list\">\n  <li><strong>Horizontal component:</strong> Fₓ = F cos θ</li>\n  <li><strong>Vertical component:</strong> F_y = F sin θ</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"learn-p\"><strong>Example:</strong> A force of 100 N acts at 30° above the horizontal. Find its components.<br>\nFₓ = 100 cos 30° = 100 × (√3/2) = 86.6 N (horizontal)<br>\nF_y = 100 sin 30° = 100 × ½ = 50 N (vertical)</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"learn-subheading\">6. Equilibrium</h3>\n<p class=\"learn-p\">A body is in <span class=\"learn-keyword\">equilibrium</span> when the resultant of all forces acting on it is zero. This means the vector sum of all forces = 0 (net force = 0). The body either remains at rest or continues moving at constant velocity.</p>\n\n<div class=\"learn-tip-box\">\n  <span class=\"learn-tip-icon\">💡</span>\n  <strong>Exam Tip — Identifying Scalars and Vectors:</strong> Key mnemonic: vectors involve MOVEMENT or FORCE with direction (velocity, displacement, force, weight, acceleration, momentum). Scalars are \"amounts\" without direction (speed, distance, mass, time, energy, temperature). A common trick question: \"Is pressure a scalar or vector?\" — Pressure is a SCALAR (magnitude only, no specific direction in a fluid). Electric field and magnetic field are VECTORS.\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"learn-tip-box\">\n  <span class=\"learn-tip-icon\">🎯</span>\n  <strong>Summary:</strong> Scalars = magnitude only (distance, speed, mass, time, energy). Vectors = magnitude + direction (displacement, velocity, acceleration, force, weight, momentum). Vectors represented by arrows (length = magnitude, direction = arrow direction). Vector addition: triangle rule (tip-to-tail) or parallelogram rule. At right angles: R = √(A²+B²). Resolution: Fₓ = F cosθ, F_y = F sinθ. Equilibrium: resultant force = 0.\n</div>\n  ",

These quantities describe HOW an object moves: how fast, in what direction, and whether the motion is changing. These concepts underpin everything from the design of Lagos traffic systems to the trajectory of Nigerian satellites and the physics of a Bolt electric car.\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"learn-subheading\">1. Speed</h3>\n<p class=\"learn-p\"><span class=\"learn-keyword\">Speed</span> is the rate of change of distance with time.

Other units: km/h (divide m/s by 3.6 or multiply km/h by 3.6 to get m/s... actually: 1 m/s = 3.6 km/h, so km/h × (1/3.6) = m/s).</p>\n<ul class=\"learn-list\">\n  <li><strong>Average speed</strong> = total distance / total time</li>\n  <li><strong>Instantaneous speed</strong> = speed at a specific instant (shown by speedometer)</li>\n  <li><strong>Uniform speed</strong> = constant speed (covers equal distances in equal time intervals)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"learn-subheading\">2.

Velocity-Time Graphs</h3>\n<p class=\"learn-p\">A velocity-time graph plots velocity (y-axis) against time (x-axis). Key features:</p>\n<ul class=\"learn-list\">\n  <li><strong>Slope (gradient)</strong> = acceleration. Positive slope = positive acceleration; negative slope = deceleration.</li>\n  <li><strong>Area under the graph</strong> = displacement (not distance — the shape can go below the x-axis).</li>\n  <li><strong>Horizontal line (v = constant)</strong> = zero acceleration (uniform velocity).</li>\n  <li><strong>Straight line with positive slope</strong> = uniform acceleration.</li>\n  <li><strong>Line reaching v = 0</strong> = object has stopped.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"learn-subheading\">5. Unit Conversions</h3>\n<p class=\"learn-p\"><strong>km/h to m/s:</strong> Divide by 3.6. Example: 90 km/h = 90/3.6 = 25 m/s</p>\n<p class=\"learn-p\"><strong>m/s to km/h:</strong> Multiply by 3.6. Example: 30 m/s = 30 × 3.6 = 108 km/h</p>\n<p class=\"learn-p\">This conversion is essential in Nigeria's road safety context — speed limits are often in km/h but physics problems use m/s.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"learn-subheading\">6. Practical Applications</h3>\n<ul class=\"learn-list\">\n  <li>Nigerian highways: speed limit 100 km/h = 27.8 m/s. Police radar guns measure instantaneous speed.</li>\n  <li>A sprinter covers 100 m in 10 s: average speed = 10 m/s = 36 km/h.</li>\n  <li>Free fall: every object near Earth accelerates at g ≈ 9.8 m/s² downward (regardless of mass).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div class=\"learn-tip-box\">\n  <span class=\"learn-tip-icon\">💡</span>\n  <strong>Exam Tip — Speed vs Velocity:</strong> \"A car goes around a roundabout at 60 km/h.\" Its SPEED is constant at 60 km/h. Its VELOCITY is constantly changing (direction changes at every point on the roundabout). Therefore there IS acceleration (change in velocity) even though speed is constant. This is the most common conceptual confusion in this topic.\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"learn-tip-box\">\n  <span class=\"learn-tip-icon\">🎯</span>\n  <strong>Summary:</strong> Speed = distance/time (scalar, m/s). Velocity = displacement/time (vector, m/s). Acceleration a = (v−u)/t (vector, m/s²). On v-t graphs: gradient = acceleration; area under graph = displacement. Convert: km/h ÷ 3.6 = m/s. Deceleration = negative acceleration. Uniform acceleration = straight line on v-t graph. A body moving in a circle at constant speed still has changing velocity (direction changes) → centripetal acceleration.\n</div>\n  ",

These four equations — derived from the definitions of velocity and acceleration — allow us to find distance, time, velocity, or acceleration when given the other quantities. They are applied daily in engineering (braking distances for Nigerian vehicles), athletics (sprint performance analysis), space science (rocket trajectories), and many other fields.\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"learn-subheading\">1. The Four Equations of Uniformly Accelerated Motion</h3>\n<p class=\"learn-p\">For constant acceleration <em>a</em>, with initial velocity <em>u</em>, final velocity <em>v</em>, displacement <em>s</em>, and time <em>t</em>:</p>\n<div class=\"learn-table-wrap\">\n  <table class=\"learn-table\">\n    <thead><tr><th>Equation</th><th>Form</th><th>Quantities Not Needed</th></tr></thead>\n    <tbody>\n      <tr><td>1st Equation</td><td>v = u + at</td><td>s (displacement)</td></tr>\n      <tr><td>2nd Equation</td><td>s = ut + ½at²</td><td>v (final velocity)</td></tr>\n      <tr><td>3rd Equation</td><td>v² = u² + 2as</td><td>t (time)</td></tr>\n      <tr><td>4th Equation</td><td>s = (u + v)t / 2</td><td>a (acceleration)</td></tr>\n    </tbody>\n  </table>\n</div>\n<p class=\"learn-p\"><strong>Memory tip:</strong> These equations only apply when acceleration is uniform (constant). For non-uniform acceleration, graphical or calculus methods are needed.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"learn-subheading\">2. Derivation of the Equations</h3>\n<p class=\"learn-p\"><strong>From the definition of acceleration:</strong> a = (v − u)/t → <strong>v = u + at</strong> (1st equation)</p>\n<p class=\"learn-p\"><strong>Average velocity:</strong> v_avg = (u + v)/2. Displacement = v_avg × t = (u + v)t/2. Also <strong>s = (u+v)t/2</strong> (4th equation).</p>\n<p class=\"learn-p\"><strong>Substitute v = u + at into 4th equation:</strong><br>\ns = (u + u + at)t/2 = (2ut + at²)/2 = ut + ½at² → <strong>s = ut + ½at²</strong> (2nd equation)</p>\n<p class=\"learn-p\"><strong>Eliminate t:</strong> From 1st: t = (v−u)/a. Substitute into 4th: s = (u+v)(v−u)/(2a) = (v²−u²)/(2a) → <strong>v² = u² + 2as</strong> (3rd equation)</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"learn-subheading\">3. Free Fall under Gravity</h3>\n<p class=\"learn-p\">Objects falling freely under gravity (ignoring air resistance) experience uniform downward acceleration g ≈ 9.8 m/s² (often taken as 10 m/s² in problems). The equations of motion apply with a = g (downward positive convention):</p>\n<ul class=\"learn-list\">\n  <li>v = u + gt</li>\n  <li>h = ut + ½gt²</li>\n  <li>v² = u² + 2gh</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"learn-p\"><strong>Key facts about free fall:</strong></p>\n<ul class=\"learn-list\">\n  <li>All objects fall with the same acceleration g regardless of mass (Galileo's observation, proven by Apollo 15 feather-hammer drop on the Moon).</li>\n  <li>Object dropped from rest: u = 0, so v = gt and h = ½gt².</li>\n  <li>Object thrown upward: at maximum height, v = 0.

Find the time to reach the ground. (g = 10 m/s²)<br>\nh = ½gt² → 20 = ½ × 10 × t² → t² = 4 → t = <strong>2 s</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"learn-p\"><strong>Example 3:</strong> A stone is thrown upward with velocity 15 m/s.

(g = 10 m/s²)<br>\nAt max height, v = 0. v² = u² − 2gh → 0 = 225 − 20h → h = <strong>11.25 m</strong><br>\nv = u − gt → 0 = 15 − 10t → t = <strong>1.5 s</strong></p>\n\n<h3 class=\"learn-subheading\">5. Graphical Analysis of Motion</h3>\n<ul class=\"learn-list\">\n  <li><strong>Displacement-time (s-t) graph:</strong> Gradient = velocity. Straight line = uniform velocity. Curve = changing velocity (acceleration).</li>\n  <li><strong>Velocity-time (v-t) graph:</strong> Gradient = acceleration. Area = displacement. Straight line with slope = uniform acceleration. Horizontal = constant velocity.</li>\n  <li><strong>Acceleration-time (a-t) graph:</strong> Horizontal line = uniform acceleration. Area = change in velocity.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div class=\"learn-tip-box\">\n  <span class=\"learn-tip-icon\">💡</span>\n  <strong>Exam Tip — Choosing the Right Equation:</strong> Identify what you know (u, v, a, s, t) and what you need to find. Then select the equation that contains both the known quantities AND the unknown. Example: \"find distance given u, a, t but NOT v\" → use s = ut + ½at² (no v). \"find velocity given u, a, s but NOT t\" → use v² = u² + 2as (no t).\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"learn-tip-box\">\n  <span class=\"learn-tip-icon\">🎯</span>\n  <strong>Summary:</strong> 4 equations of motion (uniform acceleration only): v = u+at; s = ut+½at²; v² = u²+2as; s = (u+v)t/2. Free fall: u = 0 for dropped objects; a = g ≈ 10 m/s²; at max height v = 0. Time to max height = u/g. Max height = u²/2g. s-t graph gradient = velocity. v-t graph gradient = acceleration; area = displacement. Equations fail for non-uniform acceleration.\n</div>\n  ",

Formulated by Sir Isaac Newton in his 1687 <em>Principia Mathematica</em>, these laws explain everything from why a danfo bus skids when brakes are applied suddenly, to how rockets are launched into orbit. <span class=\"learn-keyword\">Linear momentum</span> — the product of mass and velocity — is the quantity that Newton's laws ultimately govern.\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"learn-subheading\">1. Linear Momentum</h3>\n<p class=\"learn-p\"><span class=\"learn-keyword\">Linear momentum</span> (p) is the product of an object's mass and velocity:</p>\n<p class=\"learn-p\" style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>p = mv</strong></p>\n<p class=\"learn-p\">Momentum is a vector quantity (same direction as velocity). SI unit: kg m/s (or kg m s⁻¹, equivalent to N·s).</p>\n<ul class=\"learn-list\">\n  <li>A truck of mass 10,000 kg moving at 20 m/s has p = 200,000 kg m/s.</li>\n  <li>A bullet of mass 0.01 kg at 500 m/s has p = 5 kg m/s.</li>\n  <li>Larger momentum is harder to stop — this is why heavy vehicles need longer braking distances.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"learn-subheading\">2. Newton's First Law (Law of Inertia)</h3>\n<p class=\"learn-p\"><em>\"Every object continues in its state of rest or uniform motion in a straight line unless acted upon by an external unbalanced force.\"</em></p>\n<p class=\"learn-p\"><span class=\"learn-keyword\">Inertia</span> is the resistance of an object to changes in its state of motion. Greater mass = greater inertia.</p>\n<ul class=\"learn-list\">\n  <li>A passenger lurches forward when a bus brakes suddenly (inertia of passenger continues forward).</li>\n  <li>A book remains on a table (at rest) unless a force moves it.</li>\n  <li>A ball rolling on a frictionless surface would continue indefinitely (frictionless = no external force).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"learn-subheading\">3. Newton's Second Law</h3>\n<p class=\"learn-p\"><em>\"The rate of change of momentum of a body is directly proportional to the applied force and takes place in the direction of the force.\"</em></p>\n<p class=\"learn-p\" style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>F = ma</strong> (for constant mass)</p>\n<p class=\"learn-p\">More precisely: F = Δp/Δt = (mv − mu)/t = m(v−u)/t = ma</p>\n<p class=\"learn-p\">SI unit of force: newton (N) = kg m s⁻²</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"learn-subheading\">4. Newton's Third Law</h3>\n<p class=\"learn-p\"><em>\"For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.\"</em></p>\n<p class=\"learn-p\">When object A exerts a force on object B, object B exerts an equal and opposite force on object A. These forces act on DIFFERENT objects, so they do not cancel each other out.</p>\n<ul class=\"learn-list\">\n  <li>A rocket expels gas downward (action) → gas pushes rocket upward (reaction).</li>\n  <li>A gun recoils when a bullet is fired.</li>\n  <li>A swimmer pushes water backward → water pushes swimmer forward.</li>\n  <li>Earth attracts a falling apple downward; the apple also attracts Earth upward (but Earth is so massive, it doesn't visibly move).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div class=\"learn-svg-wrap\">\n  <svg class=\"learn-svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 480 200\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n    <rect width=\"480\" height=\"200\" fill=\"#0f0020\" rx=\"10\"/>\n    <text x=\"240\" y=\"18\" text-anchor=\"middle\" fill=\"#D4AF37\" font-size=\"11\" font-weight=\"bold\">Newton's Three Laws — Summary</text>\n    <rect x=\"10\" y=\"28\" width=\"145\" height=\"160\" rx=\"8\" fill=\"#1a0030\" stroke=\"#D4AF37\" stroke-width=\"1.5\"/>\n    <rect x=\"167\" y=\"28\" width=\"145\" height=\"160\" rx=\"8\" fill=\"#1a0030\" stroke=\"#28c840\" stroke-width=\"1.5\"/>\n    <rect x=\"325\" y=\"28\" width=\"145\" height=\"160\" rx=\"8\" fill=\"#1a0030\" stroke=\"#ff5f57\" stroke-width=\"1.5\"/>\n    <text x=\"82\" y=\"48\" text-anchor=\"middle\" fill=\"#D4AF37\" font-size=\"9\" font-weight=\"bold\">1st Law</text>\n    <text x=\"82\" y=\"62\" text-anchor=\"middle\" fill=\"#c8c8c8\" font-size=\"8\">Inertia</text>\n    <text x=\"82\" y=\"78\" text-anchor=\"middle\" fill=\"#9090b0\" font-size=\"7\">Body continues at</text>\n    <text x=\"82\" y=\"90\" text-anchor=\"middle\" fill=\"#9090b0\" font-size=\"7\">rest or uniform</text>\n    <text x=\"82\" y=\"102\" text-anchor=\"middle\" fill=\"#9090b0\" font-size=\"7\">motion unless</text>\n    <text x=\"82\" y=\"114\" text-anchor=\"middle\" fill=\"#9090b0\" font-size=\"7\">external force acts</text>\n    <text x=\"82\" y=\"135\" text-anchor=\"middle\" fill=\"#D4AF37\" font-size=\"8\">Net F = 0 →</text>\n    <text x=\"82\" y=\"148\" text-anchor=\"middle\" fill=\"#D4AF37\" font-size=\"8\">no change</text>\n    <text x=\"240\" y=\"48\" text-anchor=\"middle\" fill=\"#28c840\" font-size=\"9\" font-weight=\"bold\">2nd Law</text>\n    <text x=\"240\" y=\"62\" text-anchor=\"middle\" fill=\"#c8c8c8\" font-size=\"8\">F = ma</text>\n    <text x=\"240\" y=\"78\" text-anchor=\"middle\" fill=\"#9090b0\" font-size=\"7\">Force = rate of</text>\n    <text x=\"240\" y=\"90\" text-anchor=\"middle\" fill=\"#9090b0\" font-size=\"7\">change of momentum</text>\n    <text x=\"240\" y=\"105\" text-anchor=\"middle\" fill=\"#28c840\" font-size=\"9\">F = Δp/Δt = ma</text>\n    <text x=\"240\" y=\"125\" text-anchor=\"middle\" fill=\"#9090b0\" font-size=\"7\">1 N = 1 kg m/s²</text>\n    <text x=\"398\" y=\"48\" text-anchor=\"middle\" fill=\"#ff5f57\" font-size=\"9\" font-weight=\"bold\">3rd Law</text>\n    <text x=\"398\" y=\"62\" text-anchor=\"middle\" fill=\"#c8c8c8\" font-size=\"8\">Action-Reaction</text>\n    <text x=\"398\" y=\"78\" text-anchor=\"middle\" fill=\"#9090b0\" font-size=\"7\">Every action has</text>\n    <text x=\"398\" y=\"90\" text-anchor=\"middle\" fill=\"#9090b0\" font-size=\"7\">equal and opposite</text>\n    <text x=\"398\" y=\"102\" text-anchor=\"middle\" fill=\"#9090b0\" font-size=\"7\">reaction on</text>\n    <text x=\"398\" y=\"114\" text-anchor=\"middle\" fill=\"#9090b0\" font-size=\"7\">different object</text>\n    <text x=\"398\" y=\"135\" text-anchor=\"middle\" fill=\"#ff5f57\" font-size=\"8\">Rocket propulsion</text>\n    <text x=\"398\" y=\"148\" text-anchor=\"middle\" fill=\"#ff5f57\" font-size=\"8\">Gun recoil</text>\n    <rect x=\"10\" y=\"28\" width=\"145\" height=\"160\" rx=\"8\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"#D4AF37\" stroke-width=\"1\">\n      <animate attributeName=\"opacity\" values=\"0.3;0.8;0.3\" dur=\"2s\" repeatCount=\"indefinite\"/>\n    </rect>\n  </svg>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"learn-subheading\">5. Impulse</h3>\n<p class=\"learn-p\"><span class=\"learn-keyword\">Impulse</span> is the product of force and the time over which it acts:</p>\n<p class=\"learn-p\" style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>Impulse = F × t = Δp = mv − mu</strong></p>\n<p class=\"learn-p\">Impulse equals the change in momentum.

This is why: car airbags inflate (increase contact time, reduce force on passenger); cricketers draw their hands back when catching a fast ball; pole vaulters use cushioned mats.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"learn-subheading\">6.

They never cancel each other out. Common error: \"The force of gravity on a book and the table's normal reaction are action-reaction pairs.\" WRONG — normal reaction balances gravity (Newton's 1st law equilibrium); action-reaction pair would be: book pushes table down AND table pushes book up.\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"learn-tip-box\">\n  <span class=\"learn-tip-icon\">🎯</span>\n  <strong>Summary:</strong> Momentum p = mv (vector, kg m/s). Newton's 1st Law: inertia — no change in motion without net force. 2nd Law: F = ma = Δp/Δt. 3rd Law: action = equal and opposite reaction (on different objects). Impulse = Ft = Δp. Conservation of momentum: total momentum constant when no external force. Elastic collision: KE conserved. Inelastic: KE not conserved.\n</div>\n  ",

Classes of Levers</h3>\n<p class=\"learn-p\">Levers are classified by the position of the fulcrum (pivot), effort, and load:</p>\n<ul class=\"learn-list\">\n  <li><strong>Class 1:</strong> Fulcrum between load and effort. MA can be > 1 or < 1. Examples: seesaw, scissors, pliers, crowbar, claw hammer (when pulling nails).</li>\n  <li><strong>Class 2:</strong> Load between fulcrum and effort. MA always > 1. Examples: wheelbarrow, bottle opener, nutcracker, stapler.</li>\n  <li><strong>Class 3:</strong> Effort between fulcrum and load. MA always < 1 but speed is gained. Examples: forearm (elbow = fulcrum, bicep = effort, hand = load), tweezers, broom.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div class=\"learn-tip-box\">\n  <span class=\"learn-tip-icon\">💡</span>\n  <strong>Exam Tip — VR for Pulleys:</strong> For a pulley system, VR = number of rope segments supporting the load (not counting the rope you pull). For a single fixed pulley: VR = 1 (no mechanical advantage, only direction change). For a single movable pulley: VR = 2. For a block-and-tackle with n pulleys total: VR = 2n (for double purchase) or simply count supporting ropes.\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"learn-tip-box\">\n  <span class=\"learn-tip-icon\">🎯</span>\n  <strong>Summary:</strong> Machines make work easier (change force magnitude/direction). MA = Load/Effort. VR = effort distance/load distance. Efficiency = (MA/VR) × 100%. Real machines: MA < VR, efficiency < 100% (friction). Levers: Class 1 (fulcrum between), Class 2 (load between), Class 3 (effort between). Pulley VR = number of supporting ropes. Inclined plane VR = L/h. No machine reduces total work done — only force required.\n</div>\n  ",

Diffusion</h3>\n<p class=\"learn-p\"><span class=\"learn-keyword\">Diffusion</span> is the random mixing of particles of two substances due to their continuous random motion, with no overall pressure difference.

Lighter molecules diffuse faster.</li>\n  <li><strong>Examples in Nigeria:</strong> Smell of suya (grilled meat) spreading in a market; perfume spreading in a room; colour from a dye tablet spreading in water.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"learn-subheading\">5. Pressure in Gases</h3>\n<p class=\"learn-p\">Gas pressure is caused by the continuous bombardment of the container walls by rapidly moving gas molecules. Pressure increases when:</p>\n<ul class=\"learn-list\">\n  <li><strong>Temperature increases</strong> → molecules move faster → more frequent and harder collisions → higher pressure.</li>\n  <li><strong>Volume decreases</strong> (at constant temperature) → more frequent collisions with walls → higher pressure (Boyle's Law, covered in next topic).</li>\n  <li><strong>More gas is added</strong> → more molecules → more collisions → higher pressure.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div class=\"learn-tip-box\">\n  <span class=\"learn-tip-icon\">💡</span>\n  <strong>Exam Tip — Brownian Motion:</strong> Key to describe correctly: \"(1) Smoke particles are large enough to be visible; (2) Air molecules are too small to see but move fast; (3) Air molecules randomly bombard the smoke particle from all directions; (4) At any instant, more molecules hit one side than the other; (5) This imbalance changes randomly → smoke particle moves randomly.\" Common error: saying the smoke particles are molecules — they are NOT molecules, they are large aggregates of carbon particles.\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"learn-tip-box\">\n  <span class=\"learn-tip-icon\">🎯</span>\n  <strong>Summary:</strong> Kinetic theory: matter = tiny particles in continuous random motion; KE increases with temperature. Solids: regular lattice, vibrate. Liquids: random, close, translate slowly. Gases: random, far apart, move fast. Brownian motion: random jerky motion of visible particles caused by invisible molecular bombardment — evidence for molecular theory. Diffusion: random spreading from high to low concentration; gases faster than liquids. Gas pressure: from molecular bombardment of container walls.\n</div>\n  ",

Absolute Zero</h3>\n<p class=\"learn-p\">Extrapolating Charles's and the Pressure Law graphs to zero volume or pressure gives the same intercept: <strong>−273°C = 0 K</strong> (absolute zero).

In practice, absolute zero cannot be reached, only approached.</p>\n\n<div class=\"learn-tip-box\">\n  <span class=\"learn-tip-icon\">💡</span>\n  <strong>Exam Tip — Always Convert to Kelvin:</strong> The single most common error in gas law problems is using Celsius instead of Kelvin. ALWAYS convert: T(K) = T(°C) + 273. Example: 27°C = 300 K (not 27 K!). Gas laws break down completely if you use Celsius — you might get a volume of zero at 0°C, which is wrong (gas still occupies volume at 0°C, just less than at higher temperatures).\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"learn-tip-box\">\n  <span class=\"learn-tip-icon\">🎯</span>\n  <strong>Summary:</strong> Boyle's Law: PV = constant (T constant). P₁V₁ = P₂V₂. Charles's Law: V/T = constant (P constant). V₁/T₁ = V₂/T₂. Pressure Law: P/T = constant (V constant). P₁/T₁ = P₂/T₂. Combined: P₁V₁/T₁ = P₂V₂/T₂. ALWAYS use Kelvin (T_K = T_°C + 273).

SHM is the mathematical basis for understanding waves, sound, pendulum clocks, springs, musical instruments, and many other physical phenomena. It is the simplest model of periodic (repeating) motion.\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"learn-subheading\">1.

Conditions for SHM</h3>\n<p class=\"learn-p\">For SHM, the following conditions must be met:</p>\n<ol class=\"learn-list learn-ordered\">\n  <li>The motion is oscillatory (to-and-fro about equilibrium).</li>\n  <li>The restoring force is proportional to the displacement: <strong>F = −kx</strong> (the negative sign means force opposes displacement).</li>\n  <li>The restoring force always points toward the equilibrium position.</li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"learn-p\">The acceleration of SHM: <strong>a = −ω²x</strong>, where ω = angular frequency = 2πf = 2π/T</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"learn-subheading\">3.

Examples: collapse of Tacoma Narrows Bridge (wind at resonant frequency), tuning a radio (electrical resonance), microwave cooking (water molecules resonating at microwave frequency).</p>\n\n<div class=\"learn-tip-box\">\n  <span class=\"learn-tip-icon\">💡</span>\n  <strong>Exam Tip — Pendulum vs Spring:</strong> Pendulum: T = 2π√(L/g) — depends on L and g, NOT mass or amplitude. To halve the period: decrease L by factor 4 (since T ∝ √L). Spring: T = 2π√(m/k) — depends on mass and spring constant, NOT amplitude. To halve the period: decrease m by factor 4, OR increase k by factor 4.\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"learn-tip-box\">\n  <span class=\"learn-tip-icon\">🎯</span>\n  <strong>Summary:</strong> SHM: oscillatory, F = −kx (restoring force ∝ displacement), a = −ω²x. Pendulum: T = 2π√(L/g) — depends on L and g only. Spring: T = 2π√(m/k). Period and frequency: T = 1/f. Energy: PE max at amplitude, KE max at equilibrium. Total energy constant in ideal SHM. Resonance: driven at natural frequency → maximum amplitude. Damping: energy lost to friction reduces amplitude.\n</div>\n  ",

Waves are everywhere — sound reaches our ears as pressure waves in air, light from the sun travels as electromagnetic waves through empty space, earthquakes travel as seismic waves through the Earth, and radio signals in Nigeria are transmitted as electromagnetic waves. Understanding waves is fundamental to communications technology, medicine (ultrasound, X-rays), and physics.\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"learn-subheading\">1.

Examples: sound waves, water waves, seismic waves, waves on a string.</li>\n  <li><strong>Electromagnetic (EM) waves:</strong> Do NOT require a medium — can travel through a vacuum. Examples: light, radio waves, microwaves, infrared, ultraviolet, X-rays, gamma rays. All travel at c = 3 × 10⁸ m/s in vacuum.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4 class=\"learn-subsubheading\">By Direction of Vibration</h4>\n<ul class=\"learn-list\">\n  <li><strong>Transverse waves:</strong> The vibration (displacement) is PERPENDICULAR to the direction of wave travel. Examples: all electromagnetic waves, water waves, waves on a string/rope.</li>\n  <li><strong>Longitudinal waves:</strong> The vibration is PARALLEL to the direction of wave travel. Creates compressions (high pressure) and rarefactions (low pressure). Examples: sound waves, compression waves in springs.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div class=\"learn-svg-wrap\">\n  <svg class=\"learn-svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 480 200\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n    <rect width=\"480\" height=\"200\" fill=\"#0f0020\" rx=\"10\"/>\n    <text x=\"240\" y=\"18\" text-anchor=\"middle\" fill=\"#D4AF37\" font-size=\"11\" font-weight=\"bold\">Transverse vs Longitudinal Waves</text>\n    <!-- Transverse wave -->\n    <text x=\"120\" y=\"38\" text-anchor=\"middle\" fill=\"#c8b4f0\" font-size=\"9\" font-weight=\"bold\">Transverse Wave</text>\n    <text x=\"120\" y=\"50\" text-anchor=\"middle\" fill=\"#9090b0\" font-size=\"7\">(e.g., light, water wave)</text>\n    <path d=\"M20,100 Q45,60 70,100 Q95,140 120,100 Q145,60 170,100 Q195,140 220,100\" stroke=\"#D4AF37\" stroke-width=\"2.5\" fill=\"none\"/>\n    <line x1=\"20\" y1=\"100\" x2=\"225\" y2=\"100\" stroke=\"#4B0082\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke-dasharray=\"3,2\"/>\n    <polygon points=\"222,97 228,100 222,103\" fill=\"#4B0082\"/>\n    <text x=\"235\" y=\"103\" fill=\"#4B0082\" font-size=\"7\">→ direction of travel</text>\n    <!-- Vibration arrows -->\n    <line x1=\"70\" y1=\"100\" x2=\"70\" y2=\"60\" stroke=\"#28c840\" stroke-width=\"1.5\" stroke-dasharray=\"2,1\"/>\n    <line x1=\"120\" y1=\"100\" x2=\"120\" y2=\"140\" stroke=\"#28c840\" stroke-width=\"1.5\" stroke-dasharray=\"2,1\"/>\n    <text x=\"80\" y=\"78\" fill=\"#28c840\" font-size=\"7\">⬆ vibration</text>\n    <text x=\"80\" y=\"150\" fill=\"#28c840\" font-size=\"7\">⬇ (perpendicular)</text>\n    <!-- Longitudinal wave -->\n    <text x=\"350\" y=\"38\" text-anchor=\"middle\" fill=\"#c8b4f0\" font-size=\"9\" font-weight=\"bold\">Longitudinal Wave</text>\n    <text x=\"350\" y=\"50\" text-anchor=\"middle\" fill=\"#9090b0\" font-size=\"7\">(e.g., sound)</text>\n    <!-- Compressions and rarefactions -->\n    <rect x=\"255\" y=\"80\" width=\"10\" height=\"40\" rx=\"2\" fill=\"#D4AF37\" opacity=\"0.9\"/>\n    <rect x=\"272\" y=\"80\" width=\"4\" height=\"40\" rx=\"2\" fill=\"#D4AF37\" opacity=\"0.4\"/>\n    <rect x=\"283\" y=\"80\" width=\"10\" height=\"40\" rx=\"2\" fill=\"#D4AF37\" opacity=\"0.9\"/>\n    <rect x=\"300\" y=\"80\" width=\"4\" height=\"40\" rx=\"2\" fill=\"#D4AF37\" opacity=\"0.4\"/>\n    <rect x=\"311\" y=\"80\" width=\"10\" height=\"40\" rx=\"2\" fill=\"#D4AF37\" opacity=\"0.9\"/>\n    <rect x=\"328\" y=\"80\" width=\"4\" height=\"40\" rx=\"2\" fill=\"#D4AF37\" opacity=\"0.4\"/>\n    <rect x=\"339\" y=\"80\" width=\"10\" height=\"40\" rx=\"2\" fill=\"#D4AF37\" opacity=\"0.9\"/>\n    <rect x=\"356\" y=\"80\" width=\"4\" height=\"40\" rx=\"2\" fill=\"#D4AF37\" opacity=\"0.4\"/>\n    <rect x=\"367\" y=\"80\" width=\"10\" height=\"40\" rx=\"2\" fill=\"#D4AF37\" opacity=\"0.9\"/>\n    <rect x=\"384\" y=\"80\" width=\"4\" height=\"40\" rx=\"2\" fill=\"#D4AF37\" opacity=\"0.4\"/>\n    <rect x=\"395\" y=\"80\" width=\"10\" height=\"40\" rx=\"2\" fill=\"#D4AF37\" opacity=\"0.9\"/>\n    <rect x=\"412\" y=\"80\" width=\"4\" height=\"40\" rx=\"2\" fill=\"#D4AF37\" opacity=\"0.4\"/>\n    <rect x=\"423\" y=\"80\" width=\"15\" height=\"40\" rx=\"2\" fill=\"#D4AF37\" opacity=\"0.9\"/>\n    <line x1=\"255\" y1=\"130\" x2=\"438\" y2=\"130\" stroke=\"#4B0082\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke-dasharray=\"2,1\"/>\n    <polygon points=\"436,127 442,130 436,133\" fill=\"#4B0082\"/>\n    <text x=\"260\" y=\"158\" fill=\"#ff9500\" font-size=\"7\">C = compression</text>\n    <text x=\"340\" y=\"158\" fill=\"#5eb4ff\" font-size=\"7\">R = rarefaction</text>\n    <text x=\"260\" y=\"170\" fill=\"#9090b0\" font-size=\"7\">← same direction as travel →</text>\n    <text x=\"120\" y=\"183\" text-anchor=\"middle\" fill=\"#9090b0\" font-size=\"8\">Vibration ⊥ travel</text>\n    <text x=\"350\" y=\"183\" text-anchor=\"middle\" fill=\"#9090b0\" font-size=\"8\">Vibration ∥ travel</text>\n  </svg>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"learn-subheading\">2.

Progressive vs Stationary Waves</h3>\n<ul class=\"learn-list\">\n  <li><strong>Progressive (travelling) wave:</strong> Energy is transported from one place to another. All particles vibrate with the same amplitude. Phase changes continuously along the wave.</li>\n  <li><strong>Stationary (standing) wave:</strong> Formed by superposition of two identical waves travelling in opposite directions. Nodes (zero amplitude) and antinodes (maximum amplitude) form fixed positions. No net energy transport.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div class=\"learn-tip-box\">\n  <span class=\"learn-tip-icon\">💡</span>\n  <strong>Exam Tip — Transverse vs Longitudinal:</strong> The key difference: TRANSVERSE = vibration perpendicular to travel (can be polarised). LONGITUDINAL = vibration parallel to travel (cannot be polarised). Sound is always longitudinal (in any medium). Light is always transverse. Water surface waves look transverse but actually combine both (particles move in ellipses). Only TRANSVERSE waves can be polarised — this is how polaroid sunglasses work.\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"learn-tip-box\">\n  <span class=\"learn-tip-icon\">🎯</span>\n  <strong>Summary:</strong> Mechanical waves: need medium (sound, water, seismic). EM waves: no medium needed (light, radio, X-rays, gamma). Transverse: vibration ⊥ travel (light, water, rope). Longitudinal: vibration ∥ travel (sound, compression springs). EM spectrum: radio → microwave → IR → visible → UV → X-ray → gamma (decreasing λ, increasing f and energy). All waves: reflection, refraction, diffraction, interference. Only transverse: polarisation.\n</div>\n  ",

Reflection: angle in = angle out; speed, frequency, wavelength unchanged. Refraction: speed and wavelength change, frequency constant; Snell's law: n₁sinθ₁ = n₂sinθ₂. Diffraction: waves spread around obstacles; most pronounced when λ ≈ obstacle size. Interference: constructive (in phase, path diff = nλ); destructive (out of phase, path diff = (n+½)λ).
